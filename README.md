# Machine-Learning-Models
The code performs the following tasks: It loads and preprocesses the 'adult.data' dataset, converting it into a binary classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a person's income is greater than 50K or not. It applies one-hot encoding to categorical variables in the dataset. It splits the dataset into training and testing sets. It uses logistic regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression models with grid search and cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters for each model. It evaluates the performance of the models by calculating the Matthews correlation coefficient for logistic regression and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for ridge and lasso regressions. It prints the evaluation results, including the Matthews correlation coefficient, AUC scores, and the best hyperparameters and scores obtained during the grid search. Overall, the code aims to compare the performance of logistic regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression models on the 'adult.data' dataset in terms of classification accuracy and AUC.
