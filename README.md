# Machine-Learning-Models
This code performs various regression tasks using different models and evaluates their performance. It generates synthetic data for regression analysis and applies different regression models to the data. The models used in this code include Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet.
The code uses cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of the regression models. It splits the data into training and testing sets, fits the models to the training data, and calculates the mean squared error (MSE) for each model using cross-validation. The negative MSE values are then printed to compare the performance of the models.

In addition to the main analysis, the code also includes additional simulations and exploratory evaluations. It generates another set of synthetic data with smaller sample size and different noise levels. It applies the regression models to this data and calculates the MSE values. Outliers are introduced to the data, and the residuals of the linear regression model are visualized using a boxplot. Furthermore, another evaluation is performed using a different set of synthetic data, and the R-squared score and density plot of the predicted values are displayed.

Overall, this code demonstrates the implementation of various regression models, cross-validation, evaluation metrics, and exploratory analyses using synthetic data.
